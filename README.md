# MULTITHREADED-CHAT-APPLICATION
build a client server chat application using java sockets and multithreading to handle multiple users


A simple Chat application in Java for exploring higher level networking concepts in code.

Created for a University Course, this was a 5-week project which resulted in a multithreaded terminal-based application which allowed multiple users to connect to a host server, exchange global or private messages, see other active users, and to create groups and message within these groups.

This project is written in Java, and used the standard .net, .io, and .util libraries.

This project was an imporant learning experience for structuring code and designing applications, as well as programming with end-user experience in mind.
